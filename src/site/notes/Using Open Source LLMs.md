This conversation covers how to run and use open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), shifting from local execution to cloud-based coding agents.

1. Initial Overview

- **Local Options:** Free, private tools like **Ollama** (CLI) and **LM Studio** (GUI) for running models offline.
- **Hardware Requirements:** 8GB to 16GB of VRAM/RAM required for smaller 4B–8B models.

- **Cloud & Code:** Introduction to **OpenRouter** for cloud APIs and the Hugging Face `transformers` library for development.

2. Transition to AI Agents

- **The Goal:** Replicating the agentic capabilities of tools like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude (reading/writing files and running terminal commands).
- **Standalone Tools:** **Aider** (terminal-based git agent) and **PearAI** (open-source VS Code fork).
- **VS Code Extensions:** **Continue** (for sidebar chat and autocomplete) and **Cline / Roo Cline** (for autonomous, multi-step agent workflows).

3. Cloud-Hosted Open-Source Stack (Final Setup)

- **The Constraint:** Local hardware is skipped due to a lack of GPU compute power for massive models.
- **The Solution:** Pair a pay-as-you-go cloud API key from **OpenRouter** or the **DeepSeek Platform** with a frontend agent client like **Cline** or **PearAI**.
- **Top Agent Models:** **DeepSeek-V3** (complex reasoning, low cost), **Qwen-2.5-Coder 32B** (code syntax), and **Llama-3.3-70B** (strong tool-calling). [[1](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/brooke-talks-ai-with-ed-zitron)]

If you are ready to build, let me know if you want to set up **Cline** or **PearAI** first, or if you need help choosing between **DeepSeek** and **Qwen** models!
